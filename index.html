          <img src="Plant.jpg" alt="Medicinal Plant Detector" style="width: 100px; height: auto; margin-top: 5px;">
          <p><strong>Mentor Name:</strong> Dr. Manjeet Singh</p>
          <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> Machine Learning, Java, Android Studio, Image Processing & CNN</p>
          <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 01/30/23 - 05/12/23</p>
          <p>The Medicinal Plant Detector is an Android application designed to identify and detect medicinal plants and their benefits using a vast database of plant images. By employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and advanced image processing techniques, the app accurately recognizes various medicinal plant species, providing detailed information about their uses and health benefits.</p>

          <img src="IOT.jpg" alt="IoT-Based Automated Water Conservation" style="width: 100px; height: auto; margin-top: 5px;">
          <p><strong>Mentor Names:</strong> Dr. Parul Tomar and Dr. Sonam Khera</p>
          <p><strong>Skills Used:</strong> IoT, Embedded Systems, Automation, Sensor Integration</p>
          <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 28/10/2024 - 12/12/2024</p>
          <p>This project automates the repurposing of Reverse Osmosis (RO) wastewater for sustainable plant irrigation. The system collects wastewater in a storage container monitored by a water level sensor to prevent overflow. A soil moisture sensor tracks soil humidity, and when levels drop below the threshold, a relay module activates a water pump to irrigate the plants. A buzzer alerts when the container is full, ensuring timely intervention. This eco-conscious solution minimizes water wastage and reduces reliance on freshwater resources.</p>
